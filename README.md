# Medicaid-Drug-Utilization
ETL project that stores medicaid.gov drug utilization data in MySQL database and retrieves it using a SQL query. On a static web page, this project displays top ten drugs used, the number of prescriptions covered by Medicaid, and the total reimbursement amount for each drug. Only used data for Illinois and Alaska, but can use more.

Although fairly limited, one could further develop the project by adding plots to compare and contrast how Medicaid coverage occurs for these drugs in different states.
